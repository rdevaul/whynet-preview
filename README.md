# whynet-preview
created by devaul.eth on 18 November, 2022

This is a preview repository that provides early, broken, and
incomplete views into code that might become part of another project
someday. If you don't know why you are here, you probably won't gain
much from being here.

## things of interest

 * [X5](./X5) &mdash; an alternative hex grid system for the globe. Not
   H3. Intended to be fast and cheap and implementable on the
   blockchain. Could be useful for lots of things we want to verify
   on-chain where location is important.
   
 * [whynetAPI](./whynetAPI) &mdash; an API for getting information from some kind of
   distributed radio network. IDK, maybe someday this is a thing? 
   
 * [bad poetry](./poetry) &mdash; collected works &mdash; you certainly don't need
   this. move along
